### Procedures
1. Run "data_preparation_v4.R" to convert raw data for further analysis. 

2. Run part of "main_v5.R" to calculate statistics of beta-diversity variation partitioning (VP) and dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI). Run "/stegen/code/main.jl" to calculate statistics of Stegen's framework (STEGEN). Save all results in "/res/raw".

3. Run the rest of "main_v5.R" to extract the statistics values of VP, DNCI and STEGEN from the saved results in "/res/raw", and then save to the folders "/res/VP", "/res/DNCI" and "/res/Stegen", respectively.

4. Run "random_forest_v5.R" to construct random forests based on the simulated data.

5. Run "main_v5_robust.R" to prepare the subsampled simulated data and recalculate the summary statistics of beta-diversity variation partitioning (VP) and dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI). Run "/stegen/code/main_robust.jl" to calculate statistics of Stegen's framework (STEGEN). Save all results in "/res/robust".

6. Run "robustness_sampling_effort.R" to plot the relationship between sampling effort and performance in prediction.

7. Run "robustness_time_step.R" to calculate the performance of prediction after shuffling the iteration times of the input data, and plot the distribution of the performance in predicting three model parameters.

8. Run "empirical_analysis_v2.R" and "/stegen/code/empirical_v1.jl" to apply built random forest to the empirical data

8. Run "plotting_v7.R" to plot the figures.

9. Run "table_v3.R" to create tables based on the results.

10. Run "summary_v2" to get the summary of the simulated data
