# DEP_2023
In our study, we followed the framework introduced by Guzman et al. (2023, Ecology), and generated the simulated metacommunity data by the process-based metacommunity framework of Thompson et al. (2020, Ecology Letters), with several model parameters regulating the strength of different ecological processes.

See the scripts for the process-based simulation model in the folder "plthompson-Meta_com_framework-36ca456_ver1".


The scripts for analyzing the simulated metacommunity data and deriving the figures and tables in the manuscript are in the folder "analysis".
