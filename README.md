Title: Integrating several analytical methods to assess strength of ecological processes behind metacommunity assembly

Author: Ching-Lin Huang, David Zelen√Ω, Chia-Hao Chang-Yang

In our study, we followed the framework introduced by Guzman et al. (2023, Ecology), and generated the simulated metacommunity data by the process-based metacommunity framework of Thompson et al. (2020, Ecology Letters), with several model parameters regulating the strength of different ecological processes.

See the scripts for the process-based simulation model in the folder "plthompson-Meta_com_framework-36ca456_ver1".

We evaluate three analytical methods that quantify the strength of ecological processes and test their robustness in estimation based on the simulated data and random forest approach. Moreover, we apply the trained random forest to the empirical data from Fushan Forest Dynamics Plot.

The scripts for the analyses and deriving the figures and tables in the manuscript are in the folder "analysis".
