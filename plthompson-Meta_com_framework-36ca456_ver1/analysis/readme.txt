### Files description


data_preparation_v4.r
Code for transform the simulated data from Thompson's framework in julia to species composition (spe_4), trait (trait_4), environment (env_4) and distance matrix (dist_4)

main_v4.r
Do VP and DNCI for each scenarios and read Stegen's data
Store the data into res_VP, res_DNCI and res_Stegen

random_forest_v1.r
Create the RF function for applying random forest on simulated data and store the results

empirical_analysis.r
Applying the LFDP to the constructed random forests

### Procedures
0. Run "data_preparation_v4.R" to convert raw data for analysis. 

1. Folder "data" contains the species composition, species trait, environment value and distance matrix for each snapshot of simulated metacommunity (a metacommunity at an iteration time generated by a set of parametric setting).

2. Run part of "main_v5.R" to calculate statistics of beta-diversity variation partitioning (VP) and dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI). Run "/stegen/code/main.jl" to calculate statistics of Stegen's framework (STEGEN). Save all results in "/res/raw".

3. Run the rest of "main_v5.R" to extract the statistics values of VP, DNCI and STEGEN from the saved results in "/res/raw", and then save to the folders "/res/VP", "/res/DNCI" and "/res/Stegen", respectively.

4. Run "random_forest_v5.R" to create random forests based on the simulated data.

5. Run "main_v5_robust.R" to prepare the subsampled simulated data and recalculate the summary statistics of beta-diversity variation partitioning (VP) and dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI). Run "/stegen/code/main_robust.jl" to calculate statistics of Stegen's framework (STEGEN). Save all results in "/res/robust".

6. Run "robustness_sampling_effort.R" to plot the relationship between sampling effort and performance in prediction.

7. Run "robustness_time_step.R" to calculate the performance of prediction after shuffling the iteration times of the input data, plot the distribution of the performance in predicting three model parametes.

8. Run "empirical_analysis_v2.R" and "/stegen/code/empirical_v1.jl" to apply built random forest to the empirical data

8. Run "plotting_v6.R" to plot the figures.

9. Run "table_v2.R" to create tables based on the results.

10. Run "summary_v2" to get the summary of the simulated data
