1 month: 2592000 sec


Simulation:
3 hours per replicate (5 competition, 13 niche width and 16 dispersal ability)
31200 metacommunities with 60 time-steps

Total:1872000 samples


Stegen:
First step 999 permutation
6 hour per sample... in R
3 min per sample in Julia :)
Second step 999 permutation
10 sec per sample in Julia

one replicate with 4 time steps
20000 sec ~ 5 hours


DNCI:
99 perm 100 comm
16 min per sample
99 perm 50 comm
4 min per sample

one replicate with 4 time steps
9 hours



20 time steps for each rep

5 time set x 14 hour x 18 rep = 1260 hr / 10
